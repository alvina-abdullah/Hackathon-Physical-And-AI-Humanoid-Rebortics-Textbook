# Research: Module 4 — Vision-Language-Action (VLA) & The Autonomous Humanoid

## Decision: Docusaurus Documentation Structure
**Rationale**: Following the same structure as Module-1, Module-2, and Module-3 to maintain consistency across the course. Docusaurus provides built-in features like search, versioning, and responsive design that are essential for educational content.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Different directory structures
- Alternative static site generators
- Separate documentation systems

## Decision: VLA Concepts Focus
**Rationale**: The concept-first approach aligns with educational best practices for technical subjects. Students need to understand the fundamental concepts before diving into implementation details.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Implementation-first approach
- Tool-specific focus without conceptual foundation
- Mixed approach combining concepts and implementation

## Decision: VLA-to-Autonomy Pipeline
**Rationale**: The content flows logically from VLA systems (Chapter 1) to voice-to-action pipelines (Chapter 2) to complete autonomous systems (Chapter 3), creating a coherent learning progression that mirrors how these systems work in practice.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Random ordering of topics
- Implementation-focused sequence
- Hardware-first approach

## Decision: Multimodal AI Coverage
**Rationale**: Focus on the key VLA components (vision, language, action) that are most relevant for humanoid robotics, rather than comprehensive coverage of all multimodal AI techniques.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Equal focus on all multimodal components
- Tool-specific deep dives
- Combined platform approach
