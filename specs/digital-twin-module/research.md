# Research: Module-2 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Decision: Docusaurus Documentation Structure
**Rationale**: Following the same structure as Module-1 to maintain consistency across the course. Docusaurus provides built-in features like search, versioning, and responsive design that are essential for educational content.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Different directory structures
- Alternative static site generators
- Separate documentation systems

## Decision: Digital Twin Concepts Focus
**Rationale**: The concept-first approach aligns with educational best practices for technical subjects. Students need to understand the fundamental concepts before diving into implementation details.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Implementation-first approach
- Tool-specific focus without conceptual foundation
- Mixed approach combining concepts and implementation

## Decision: Gazebo vs Unity Distinction
**Rationale**: Gazebo excels in physics simulation while Unity excels in visual rendering. For this module, we focus on the conceptual differences rather than implementation details, as per the requirements.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Equal focus on both platforms
- Tool-specific deep dives
- Combined platform approach

## Decision: Sensor Simulation Approach
**Rationale**: Focus on how sensors work conceptually and their role in AI training, rather than implementation details. This maintains the concept-first approach and prepares students for later modules.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Implementation-focused sensor tutorials
- Hardware-specific sensor details
- Code-heavy sensor integration examples
