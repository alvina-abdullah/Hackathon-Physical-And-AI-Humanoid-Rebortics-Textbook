# Research: Module 3 — The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Decision: Docusaurus Documentation Structure
**Rationale**: Following the same structure as Module-1 and Module-2 to maintain consistency across the course. Docusaurus provides built-in features like search, versioning, and responsive design that are essential for educational content.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Different directory structures
- Alternative static site generators
- Separate documentation systems

## Decision: Isaac Platform Concepts Focus
**Rationale**: The concept-first approach aligns with educational best practices for technical subjects. Students need to understand the fundamental concepts before diving into implementation details.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Implementation-first approach
- Tool-specific focus without conceptual foundation
- Mixed approach combining concepts and implementation

## Decision: Perception-to-Navigation Pipeline
**Rationale**: The content flows logically from perception (Chapter 1) to spatial intelligence (Chapter 2) to navigation (Chapter 3), creating a coherent learning progression that mirrors how these systems work in practice.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Random ordering of topics
- Implementation-focused sequence
- Hardware-first approach

## Decision: NVIDIA Isaac Ecosystem Coverage
**Rationale**: Focus on the key Isaac components (Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2 integration) that are most relevant for humanoid robotics, rather than comprehensive coverage of all Isaac tools.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Equal focus on all Isaac components
- Tool-specific deep dives
- Combined platform approach
