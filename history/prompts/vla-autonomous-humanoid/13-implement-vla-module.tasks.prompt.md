## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented Module 4 — Vision-Language-Action (VLA) & The Autonomous Humanoid with all 52 tasks completed across 6 phases:

- Phase 1: Setup (4/4 tasks completed) - Module directory and files created
- Phase 2: Foundational (4/4 tasks completed) - Navigation and configuration updated
- Phase 3: US1 (11/11 tasks completed) - Vision-Language-Action Systems understanding
- Phase 4: US2 (11/11 tasks completed) - Voice-to-Action and Cognitive Planning
- Phase 5: US3 (12/12 tasks completed) - Capstone Autonomous Humanoid system
- Phase 6: Polish (10/10 tasks completed) - Validation and completion

Created three comprehensive chapters with proper frontmatter, conceptual explanations, and humanoid robotics examples. All content meets functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-009) and success criteria (SC-001 through SC-008). Updated sidebar configuration includes the new module with proper navigation structure. This module serves as the capstone learning experience, completing the course narrative from middleware to autonomy.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete VLA autonomous humanoid module with 3 chapters implemented
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created 3 chapter files, updated tasks, and updated sidebar configuration
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for deployment or next course module
- 🧠 Reflection: Implementation followed spec-first approach with Docusaurus compliance

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
