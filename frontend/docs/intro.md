# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to a comprehensive learning hub focused on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics—where artificial intelligence moves beyond screens and into the real world through embodied systems.

This documentation is built using Docusaurus, providing a fast, structured, and scalable way to learn, document, and experiment with topics such as perception, motion, control, cognition, and human–robot interaction.

## 🤖 What You'll Learn

This textbook covers:

- **ROS 2 (Robotic Nervous System)** - The communication framework that enables humanoid robots to coordinate complex behaviors
- **Simulation with Gazebo & Unity (Digital Twins)** - Creating accurate virtual replicas for testing and training
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Isaac ROS** - Advanced AI tools for perception and navigation
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems** - Enabling robots to understand and execute human commands
